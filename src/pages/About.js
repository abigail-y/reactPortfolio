      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm Abi — a passionate developer and designer who loves building interactive, beautiful web experiences. Whether it’s coding up smooth UI or experimenting with creative visuals, I’m all about bringing ideas to life!
        A little more about me is that I love music! I've been been playing trombone for over 7 years and have been a part of Marching Knights with UCF for two years. 
        During my free time I enjoy going out with my friends and it's my dream to open up my own Cafe where I design everything!
